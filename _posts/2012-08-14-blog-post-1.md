And finally yes, I have a master's degree in thefiled i'm trying to be an expert. I wouldn't expect it to be a like this, but in other's mind it sounds big but in my own head it sounds like a start, like from now it's getting more seroiuos. But I use it as a motivatio to apply what I have learnt to my Ph.D journey, hope it goes well but that's the thing, we should be always on the learning curve, doesn;t matter where we are, the delta function acts always not the static levels.
