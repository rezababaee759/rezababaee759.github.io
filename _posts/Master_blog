And finally, yes, I have a master's degree in the field I'm trying to be an expert in. I wouldn't expect it to be like this, but in others' minds, it sounds big. In my own head, it feels like just the beginning, like from now on it’s getting more serious. But I use it as motivation to apply what I have learned to my Ph.D. journey. I hope it goes well, but that's the thing—we should always be on the learning curve. It doesn’t matter where we are, the delta function always applies, not static levels.
