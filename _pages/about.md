welcome! 

A personal website
======
Welcome to my corner of the web. I created this space to serve as a digital sketchbook of sorts, a place where I can share updates on my academic research alongside the more personal experiments in my life, like my attempts at staying active and eating well. My hope is that by sharing these different perspectives, whether technical or personal, something here might prove useful or encouraging to you

Academic journey
------
My journey began at KNTU, a place I still look back on with a lot of fondness for the friends and the vibrant atmosphere that shaped me academic journey. Recently, I reached a major milestone by completing my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Now, I’m stepping into the next chapter: pursuing a Ph.D. It’s a path that feels equal parts daunting and exciting, but I’m looking forward to seeing where the research leads..

Diet and more
------
Where to even begin? If there is one thing I’ve learned recently, it’s that the keto lifestyle truly delivers results when approached with the right philosophy. A huge thanks to my good friend Ehsan in Stockholm for the initial inspiration. For me, the secret hasn't been in complex recipes, but in sticking to high-quality, single ingredients and, most importantly, radical consistency.

Stay in Touch
------
I’m always open to meeting new people and hearing different perspectives. If you prefer a longer conversation, drop me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
