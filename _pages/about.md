welcome! 

A personal website
======
In this page I will share my interests, varying from my academic research, also some life updates on how diets and excercise is going. I may share more on some other perspectives of life as well. So, yeah this will be my spot to share everything I think could be useful to the world!

Academic journey
------
Starting from KNTU, oh I miss it so much with my lovely friends and the vibe!, and recently just got my M.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering, hurray! and yeah, continuing my journey to be Ph.D., it's a bit scary but we'll see what happens.

Diet and more
------
Where should I even start? but let me tell you something, keto really works. Shout out to my great friend Ehsan from Stockholm. 

**Oops!**

These are only what I think, so don't take it personal!

For more, follow me on instagram, or just email me so we may have a chat!
